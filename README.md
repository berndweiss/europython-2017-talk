# Jupyter Notebooks for Teaching and Learning

These are slides and notes from my talk at EuroPython 2017.

Like most of my talks, the slides do not convey much information by themselves.
The talk was recorded, and you can [view it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zzt5Z_fZcW0&feature=youtu.be&t=2h56m15s).
